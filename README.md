# Startup-Profit-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
Startup Profit Prediction Using Linear Regression - A machine learning project that predicts the profit of a startup based on features like R&amp;D Spend, Administration, and Marketing Spend using Linear Regression. Built using Scikit-learn and visualized with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### Features:
- Utilized Multiple Linear Regression to predict startup profits.

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset by removing categorical variables (State column).

- Visualized feature correlation using Seaborn heatmaps to identify strong predictors.

- Split dataset into 80% training and 20% testing for effective model evaluation.

- Used RÂ² Score for model evaluation to measure prediction accuracy.

- Deployed the model on a sample startup input to predict potential profit.

### Tech Stack:
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn
